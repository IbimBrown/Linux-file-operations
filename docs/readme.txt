This project was created to practice basic Linux file and directory operations 
and user/group permissions using WSL Ubuntu.

## Tasks Completed
1. Created project structure with directories: docs, logs, configs.
2. Added files: readme.txt, error.log, access.log, nginx.conf.
3. Practiced file operations:
   - Create files and directories (mkdir, touch)
   - Move, copy, rename, and delete files (mv, cp, rm)
   - Write and append text to files (echo, >, >>)
   - View file contents (cat, head, tail)
4. Practiced user and group permissions:
   - Created users and groups (adduser, groupadd, usermod)
   - Changed file ownership (chown)
   - Set file and directory permissions (chmod 770, chmod 600)
   - Made a script executable (chmod +x start.sh)

## Learning Outcome
By completing these tasks, I learned how to manage files, directories, users, 
and permissions in Linux, which are essential skills for system administration 
and cloud engineering..
